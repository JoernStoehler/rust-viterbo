You are a fresh agent being evaluated for repo onboarding.
STRICT READ-ONLY: do not modify files, do not create files, do not run mutating commands.
You may only read the following files and nothing else:
- AGENTS.md (workspace root)
- docs/src/meta/overview.md
- README.md

Do not read other files. Do not run cargo, scripts, or network. If you mention commands, present them as illustrative only and do not execute.

Tasks
1) Core understanding (cite file paths you read):
- Summarize the mission and the ticket → thesis → code/tests workflow.
- State the canonical locations for:
  - Always-relevant conventions.
  - Long-term but only-sometimes-relevant meta conventions.
  - Temporary but universal notices.
- Confirm whether there are any “Active Notices” right now and how you would consume them.

2) Repo conventions (answer succinctly, citing files):
- Where do heavy outputs go? Where do small publishable artifacts go?
- Where exactly do you write provenance.json?
- CI policy: how to run it; whether GitHub Actions are used.
- Safe runner policy for long commands (name + how it’s used).
- Cross-references: how TH and VK are used (code ↔ thesis ↔ tickets).
- Libraries stance for data IO (Polars) including feature-gating policy.
- Testing RNG convention for reproducibility.
- Pre-commit hooks policy and commit message expectation re: VK.

3) Dry-run plan for a hypothetical ticket (do not implement; just plan)
Ticket: VK 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000. Add a new CLI subcommand “stats” that:
- Reads a CSV input and computes trivial row/column counts.
- Writes heavy output JSON under data/<ticket>/stats.json and a provenance.json next to it.
- Optionally produces a small figure artifact under docs/assets/<ticket>/stats_preview.json and a provenance.json next to it.
Without reading other code files, produce:
- An 8–12 step plan that respects conventions (docs and code cross-refs, outputs, provenance, CI, safety).
- Exact file paths you would change or create and why (e.g., crates/cli/src/main.rs, docs entries for anchors, etc.).
- The exact illustrative commands you would run for CI and for long jobs, including how you would wrap long jobs. Do not execute them.
- Acceptance criteria for the ticket (bullet points).
- A sample commit message referencing the VK ID.

4) Guardrails and escalation
- List which situations would trigger escalation for this ticket.
- Call out any ambiguity you found in the docs and propose one-line improvements to AGENTS.md or meta to resolve it.

5) Compliance check
- Explicitly confirm you only read: AGENTS.md, docs/src/meta/overview.md, README.md, and that you did not modify or execute anything.

Answer format
- Use short sections with bullets.
- Include file citations like: AGENTS.md:line, docs/src/meta/overview.md:line, README.md:line.
- Include all commands as illustrative code blocks or inline snippets; do not run anything.
