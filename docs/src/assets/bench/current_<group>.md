This is a placeholder file for mdBook link checking.

The docs include an example literal include path `{{#include ../assets/bench/current_<group>.md}}`.
To avoid link-preprocessor errors, we keep this tiny placeholder. Real generated
snapshots for concrete groups (e.g., `current_poly2.md`) are written by
`viterbo.bench.stage_docs`.
