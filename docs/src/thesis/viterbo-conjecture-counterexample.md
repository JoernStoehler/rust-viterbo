State the counterexample. Reference the paper by Heim-Kisliv (2024) and show a plot of the counterexample polytope (projection on p, q spaces), the minimum action orbit, and the algebraic value and numerical value of the systolic ratio.

Explain roughly how the counterexample was found by Heim-Kisliv, e.g. the idea that 90° rotation is best, since the Mahler conjecture is known to be true in 2d, so the 180° rotation is known to yield systolic ratio <= 1.
