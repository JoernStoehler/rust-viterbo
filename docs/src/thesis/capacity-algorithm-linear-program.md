Please look up the Helm-Kisliv paper on computing symplectic capacities (2017-19 iirc) and define here in mathematical, precise, specific, clear, unambiguous, and where appropriate formal language the linear/quadratic programming algorithm she developed.

You can consulte the oriented-edge algorithm writeup for the level of detail I find appropriate when specifying algorithms.
