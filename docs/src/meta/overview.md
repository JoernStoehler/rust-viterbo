# Meta Documentation

This section hosts documentation about meta-level development workflows (not object-level content).

- Agent onboarding and always-relevant rules: see `AGENTS.md` at the workspace root.
- Topic-specific meta docs that only some tickets need live here (e.g., data IO, CI/tooling).
